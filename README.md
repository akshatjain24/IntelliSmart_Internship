The code iterates through each day between the start and end dates.
For each day, it processes different CSV files, writes them to separate Excel files, and then extracts information from these files to populate the main Excel file based on certain conditions.
The code overall reads, processes, and compiles data from CSVs into an Excel file, organizing it in a structured format.<br>
<h3>Automation of Data given by Crystal(vendor)</h3>
